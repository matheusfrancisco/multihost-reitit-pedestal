# Interceptor to multi host with reitit


Currently I run into using reitit with multi-host like pedestal-routes
[here pedestal multi host](http://pedestal.io/pedestal/0.6/reference/table-syntax.html)
then I opened this [issue](https://github.com/metosin/reitit/issues/660) so I implement 
this interceptor
