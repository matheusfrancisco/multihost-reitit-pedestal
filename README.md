# Interceptor to multi host with reitit

I encountered issues using Reitit for multi-host routing, similar to Pedestal's approach, leading me to open an [issue](https://github.com/metosin/reitit/issues/660) for implementing a related interceptor. To utilize Swagger, I'm transitioning from Moclojer to Reitit, where we're already applying multi-host configurations as seen here: https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer/blob/main/src/com/moclojer/specs/moclojer.clj#L69.
